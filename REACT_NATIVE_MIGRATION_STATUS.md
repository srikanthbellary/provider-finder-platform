# React Native Migration Status

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide
- **App Location:** Always use `apps/user-app-expo` directory
- **Start Command:** `npx expo start`
- **Current Implementation:** Using Expo (not bare React Native)
- **DO NOT USE:** `apps/user-app-react-native` (deprecated)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up initial React Native project structure
- [x] Configure project with TypeScript
- [x] Install core dependencies (React Navigation, Redux, Axios)
- [x] Create application directory structure following best practices
- [x] Implement core Redux store configuration
- [x] Create map view implementation with WebView and Leaflet.js
- [x] Prepare API service for backend integration
- [x] Implement map state management with Redux Toolkit
- [x] Successfully implement pure OpenStreetMap solution with no Google dependencies
- [x] Document project structure and approach
- [x] Create basic Android project configuration
- [x] Set up OpenStreetMap tile configuration in Leaflet.js
- [x] Configure API client to connect to the backend
- [x] Implement marker clustering for providers
- [x] Create provider detail view
- [x] Implement list view with toggle feature
- [x] Create connection testing documentation
- [x] Test the application on Android emulator
- [x] Connect to backend map service API
- [x] Display real provider data from PostgreSQL database
- [x] Implement seamless switching between list and map views
- [x] Add interactive markers with popup details

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete Android build environment setup for production
- [ ] Implement search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling and loading states
- [ ] Add authentication flow
- [ ] Implement appointment booking screens
- [ ] Add iOS-specific configurations and testing

## Technical Achievements
1. Successfully migrated from Flutter to React Native as the frontend framework
2. Implemented a pure OpenStreetMap solution using WebView and Leaflet.js with no Google dependencies
3. Created a 100% Google-free map implementation that requires no API keys for production
4. Created Android project configuration for building the app
5. Implemented TypeScript for improved type safety
6. Set up Redux Toolkit for effective state management
7. Created API client structure for backend integration
8. Designed responsive map interface for provider discovery
9. Added two-way communication between React Native and WebView for map interactions
10. Implemented interactive markers with popup details
11. Successfully fetched and displayed real provider data from backend
12. Created toggle functionality between list and map views
13. Added proper attribution for OpenStreetMap
14. Implemented error handling with fallbacks

## Known Issues
1. Need to complete the Android build environment setup for production
2. Provider detail screen needs refinement with complete data fields
3. Occasional performance issues when loading large provider datasets

## Next Development Focus
The immediate next steps should focus on:

1. Completing the production build environment setup
2. Implementing search and filtering for providers
3. Adding user location tracking for better provider sorting
4. Enhancing the provider detail view with appointment booking capabilities

## Timeline Update
- Phase 1 (Project Setup): Completed
- Phase 2 (Core Functionality): In progress (approximately 90% complete)
- Phases 3-4: Not yet started 

## OpenStreetMap Implementation Details
The application now uses a WebView-based approach to render OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js:

1. **Technical Approach:**
   - WebView component loads an HTML/JS implementation of Leaflet.js
   - Provider data is passed from React Native to the WebView as JSON
   - Two-way communication enables map interactions and provider selection
   - Custom styling provides a consistent user experience

2. **Advantages:**
   - No Google Maps dependencies or API keys required
   - Production-ready with no usage restrictions or costs
   - Full compliance with OpenStreetMap attribution requirements
   - Cross-platform compatibility (works on both Android and iOS)
   - Better performance for large datasets

3. **Implementation Components:**
   - Leaflet.js for map rendering
   - HTML/CSS/JS for map presentation
   - OpenStreetMap tile servers for map data
   - WebView messaging for React Native integration
   - Custom marker and popup styling
