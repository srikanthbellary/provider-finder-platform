# React Native Migration Status

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide
- **App Location:** Always use `apps/user-app-expo` directory
- **Start Command:** `npx expo start --android --clear`
- **Current Implementation:** Using Expo (not bare React Native)
- **DO NOT USE:** `apps/user-app-react-native` (deprecated)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up initial React Native project structure
- [x] Configure project with TypeScript
- [x] Install core dependencies (React Navigation, Redux, Axios)
- [x] Create application directory structure following best practices
- [x] Implement core Redux store configuration
- [x] Create map view component with react-native-maps
- [x] Prepare API service for backend integration
- [x] Implement map state management with Redux Toolkit
- [x] Create placeholder for OpenStreetMap integration
- [x] Document project structure and approach
- [x] Create basic Android project configuration
- [x] Set up OpenStreetMap tile configuration
- [x] Configure API client to connect to the backend
- [x] Implement marker clustering for providers
- [x] Create provider detail view
- [x] Create connection testing documentation
- [x] Test the application on Android emulator
- [x] Connect to backend map service API
- [x] Display real provider data from PostgreSQL database
- [x] Implement custom zoom controls for map navigation
- [x] Add provider detail cards with interactive elements

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete Android build environment setup for production
- [ ] Implement search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Enhance error handling and loading states
- [ ] Add authentication flow
- [ ] Implement appointment booking screens
- [ ] Add iOS-specific configurations and testing

## Technical Achievements
1. Successfully migrated from Flutter to React Native as the frontend framework
2. Implemented OpenStreetMap integration with react-native-maps
3. Created Android project configuration for building the app
4. Implemented TypeScript for improved type safety
5. Set up Redux Toolkit for effective state management
6. Created API client structure for backend integration
7. Designed responsive map interface for provider discovery
8. Added support for multiple map tile styles
9. Implemented marker clustering for better performance
10. Created provider detail screen with directions/calling functionality
11. Successfully fetched and displayed real provider data from backend
12. Implemented custom zoom controls for better map navigation
13. Added error handling with fallback to mock data when connection fails

## Known Issues
1. Need to complete the Android build environment setup for production
2. Provider detail screen needs refinement with complete data fields
3. Occasional performance issues when loading large provider datasets

## Next Development Focus
The immediate next steps should focus on:

1. Completing the production build environment setup
2. Implementing search and filtering for providers
3. Adding user location tracking for better provider sorting
4. Enhancing the provider detail view with appointment booking capabilities

## Timeline Update
- Phase 1 (Project Setup): Completed
- Phase 2 (Core Functionality): In progress (approximately 85% complete)
- Phases 3-4: Not yet started
