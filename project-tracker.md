## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Frontend Framework Migration
- **Decision:** Migrating from Flutter to React Native due to improved community support
- **Impact:** Complete rewrite of frontend applications while backend remains unchanged
- **Advantages:**
  - Larger developer community and ecosystem
  - Strong corporate backing (Facebook/Meta)
  - Mature mapping libraries with OpenStreetMap support
  - TypeScript support for improved type safety
  - Potential for code sharing with web applications
- **Migration Strategy:**
  1. Begin with a proof-of-concept for map features
  2. Phase the transition rather than a complete pause-and-rewrite
  3. Focus on critical path features first (provider search via map)
  4. Reuse backend APIs without modification
- **Key Technical Components:**
  - React Native core
  - React Navigation for routing
  - Redux Toolkit and React Query for state management
  - WebView with Leaflet.js for pure OpenStreetMap integration
  - Styled components approach for theming

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Database initialization script created with tables in provider schema
- PostGIS extensions enabled and verified working
- Successfully imported 1,219 test provider records from JSON source data

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Viewport-based provider search implemented in Map Service
- Redis caching temporarily disabled due to authentication issues
- Fixed various issues with map-service endpoints:
  - Added proper exception handling for native SQL queries
  - Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in provider search endpoint
  - Improved error response formats with contextual information
  - Modified SQL queries to use proper schema prefixes (`provider.location`)
  - Implemented fallback approach for distance-based sorting
- Comprehensive error response handling added with global exception handler
- Distance-based sorting for providers near user location

### OpenStreetMap Implementation
- **Major Decision:** Implemented a 100% Google-free OpenStreetMap solution with no API key requirements
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  1. WebView-based approach using Leaflet.js for rendering OpenStreetMap tiles
  2. No dependency on Google Maps or react-native-maps
  3. Fully interactive map with custom markers and popup details
  4. Proper attribution to OpenStreetMap contributors
  5. Seamless switching between list and map views
- **Technical Components:**
  - WebView integration with Leaflet.js
  - Client-side HTML/JS for map rendering
  - JSON serialization for provider data
  - Two-way communication between React Native and WebView
  - Custom styling for map elements and provider markers
- **Advantages:**
  - No API key costs or usage limits for production
  - Complete independence from Google services
  - Fully compliant with OpenStreetMap usage policies
  - Works consistently across Android and iOS
  - Better performance with optimized marker rendering
- Backend map service already provider-agnostic (using PostGIS)
- Successfully connected to backend map service and displaying real provider data
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback

### Docker Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS container running and verified
- Redis container configured for future caching needs
- Elasticsearch container added for future text search capabilities
- Docker Compose configuration complete and functional
- Map Service containerized and connected to PostgreSQL successfully

  4. Created interactive markers with popup details
  5. Implemented seamless toggle between list and map views
  6. Added proper attribution for OpenStreetMap
  7. Ensured production-readiness with no API key dependencies
- Next priorities: 
  1. Implement search and filtering functionality for providers
  2. Add user location tracking for better provider sorting
  3. Enhance the provider detail view with appointment capabilities
  4. Set up authentication flow
  5. Prepare Android build environment for production deployment
  6. Begin iOS testing and configuration
