## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Database initialization script created with tables in provider schema
- PostGIS extensions enabled and verified working

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Viewport-based provider search implemented in Map Service
- Caching with Redis for frequent viewport queries
- Distance-based sorting for providers near user location

### Build and CI/CD Approach
- Maven Wrapper approach selected for consistent builds across environments
- Encountered build issues with Maven Wrapper that need resolution
- Docker containers configured and running successfully

### Docker Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS container running and verified
- Redis container running for caching
- Elasticsearch container added for future text search capabilities
- Docker Compose configuration complete and functional

## Environment Information
- Development IDE: Cursor
- Java version: 17
- Spring Boot version: 2.7.9
- Docker version: 24.0.6

## Notes for Continuity Between Sessions
Add specific details here that would be helpful for continuing development in a new chat session:

- Current focus: Map Service build and implementation
- Pending issues: Maven Wrapper build failure needs debugging
- Recent changes: Docker infrastructure configured and verified functioning
- Next priorities: 
  1. Fix Map Service build issues
  2. Begin development of Flutter UI with map component
