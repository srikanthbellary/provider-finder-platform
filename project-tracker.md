## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Appointment system using transactional capabilities

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Real-time WebSocket connections for notifications and map updates
- GraphQL consideration for complex filtering (decision pending)

### Authentication Flow
- Google authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Separate auth tokens for user and provider apps

### Frontend State Management
- Provider TBD (Riverpod, Bloc, etc.)
- Caching strategy for offline operation
- Map state management approach
