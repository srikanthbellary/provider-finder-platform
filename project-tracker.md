## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Frontend Framework Migration
- **Decision:** Migrating from Flutter to React Native due to improved community support
- **Impact:** Complete rewrite of frontend applications while backend remains unchanged
- **Advantages:**
  - Larger developer community and ecosystem
  - Strong corporate backing (Facebook/Meta)
  - Mature mapping libraries with OpenStreetMap support
  - TypeScript support for improved type safety
  - Potential for code sharing with web applications
- **Migration Strategy:**
  1. Begin with a proof-of-concept for map features
  2. Phase the transition rather than a complete pause-and-rewrite
  3. Focus on critical path features first (provider search via map)
  4. Reuse backend APIs without modification
- **Key Technical Components:**
  - React Native core
  - React Navigation for routing
  - Redux Toolkit and React Query for state management
  - WebView with Leaflet.js for pure OpenStreetMap integration
  - Styled components approach for theming

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Database initialization script created with tables in provider schema
- PostGIS extensions enabled and verified working
- Successfully imported 1,219 test provider records from JSON source data

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Viewport-based provider search implemented in Map Service
- Redis caching temporarily disabled due to authentication issues
- Fixed various issues with map-service endpoints:
  - Added proper exception handling for native SQL queries
  - Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in provider search endpoint
  - Improved error response formats with contextual information
  - Modified SQL queries to use proper schema prefixes (`provider.location`)
  - Implemented fallback approach for distance-based sorting
- Comprehensive error response handling added with global exception handler
- Distance-based sorting for providers near user location

### OpenStreetMap Implementation
- **Major Decision:** Implemented a 100% Google-free OpenStreetMap solution with no API key requirements
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  1. WebView-based approach using Leaflet.js for rendering OpenStreetMap tiles
  2. No dependency on Google Maps or react-native-maps
  3. Fully interactive map with custom markers and popup details
  4. Proper attribution to OpenStreetMap contributors
  5. Seamless switching between list and map views
- **Technical Components:**
  - WebView integration with Leaflet.js
  - Client-side HTML/JS for map rendering
  - JSON serialization for provider data
  - Two-way communication between React Native and WebView
  - Custom styling for map elements and provider markers
- **Advantages:**
  - No API key costs or usage limits for production
  - Complete independence from Google services
  - Fully compliant with OpenStreetMap usage policies
  - Works consistently across Android and iOS
  - Better performance with optimized marker rendering
- Backend map service already provider-agnostic (using PostGIS)
- Successfully connected to backend map service and displaying real provider data
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback

### Docker Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS container running and verified
- Redis container configured for future caching needs
- Elasticsearch container added for future text search capabilities
- Docker Compose configuration complete and functional
- Map Service containerized and connected to PostgreSQL successfully

### New User Flow Implementation
- **Decision:** Implementing a home screen with Search/Chat/Voice options
- **Impact:** More intuitive user experience with multiple input methods
- **Advantages:**
  - Clearer entry points for different user needs
  - Structured approach to provider discovery
  - Future-ready for AI-powered chat and voice features
  - Better symptom-to-specialist mapping
  - Improved user engagement through multiple interaction options

### Symptom-to-Specialist Mapping
- **Decision:** Using JSON-based mapping for symptoms to specialists
- **Impact:** More accurate provider recommendations
- **Advantages:**
  - Easy to maintain and update mappings
  - Supports multiple languages
  - Can be extended with AI suggestions
  - Improves search accuracy
  - Better user experience through guided specialist selection

### Service Discovery Implementation
- **Decision:** Implement Eureka Server for service discovery instead of relying on direct linking.
- **Impact:** Requires implementing the `discovery-server` component and configuring all other services as Eureka clients.
- **Advantages:** Enables dynamic scaling, load balancing, and improved resilience in a microservices environment.
- **Current Status:** Build failing due to missing `discovery-server` implementation. Blocked chat-service build.
