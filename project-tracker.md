## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Frontend Framework Migration
- **Decision:** Migrating from Flutter to React Native due to improved community support
- **Impact:** Complete rewrite of frontend applications while backend remains unchanged
- **Advantages:**
  - Larger developer community and ecosystem
  - Strong corporate backing (Facebook/Meta)
  - Mature mapping libraries with OpenStreetMap support
  - TypeScript support for improved type safety
  - Potential for code sharing with web applications
- **Migration Strategy:**
  1. Begin with a proof-of-concept for map features
  2. Phase the transition rather than a complete pause-and-rewrite
  3. Focus on critical path features first (provider search via map)
  4. Reuse backend APIs without modification
- **Key Technical Components:**
  - React Native core
  - React Navigation for routing
  - Redux Toolkit and React Query for state management
  - react-native-maps with OSM configuration
  - Styled components approach for theming

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Database initialization script created with tables in provider schema
- PostGIS extensions enabled and verified working
- Successfully imported 1,219 test provider records from JSON source data

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Viewport-based provider search implemented in Map Service
- Redis caching temporarily disabled due to authentication issues
- Fixed various issues with map-service endpoints:
  - Added proper exception handling for native SQL queries
  - Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in provider search endpoint
  - Improved error response formats with contextual information
  - Modified SQL queries to use proper schema prefixes (`provider.location`)
  - Implemented fallback approach for distance-based sorting
- Comprehensive error response handling added with global exception handler
- Distance-based sorting for providers near user location

### OpenStreetMap Implementation
- Decision to use OpenStreetMap with React Native for cost optimization
- Backend map service already provider-agnostic (using PostGIS)
- Implementation with the following components:
  1. react-native-maps with OSM tile configuration implemented via custom OSMMapView component
  2. Multiple tile styles implemented (standard, humanitarian, cycleMap, transport)
  3. Provider marker rendering implemented with clustering for better performance
  4. Custom zoom controls added for improved user experience
- Tile server options configured:
  - Standard OSM tiles (free, no API key required)
  - Humanitarian tiles as an alternative style
  - Cycle and Transport maps from Thunderforest
- API service layer implemented for communicating with backend
- Map service slice created with Redux Toolkit for state management
- Custom environment configuration created for different deployment targets
- Successfully connected to backend map service and displaying real provider data

### Docker Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS container running and verified
- Redis container configured for future caching needs
- Elasticsearch container added for future text search capabilities
- Docker Compose configuration complete and functional
- Map Service containerized and connected to PostgreSQL successfully

  2. Add user location tracking for better provider sorting
  3. Enhance the provider detail view with appointment capabilities
  4. Set up authentication flow
  5. Prepare Android build environment for production deployment
  6. Begin iOS testing and configuration
