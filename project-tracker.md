## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Database initialization script created with tables in provider schema
- PostGIS extensions enabled and verified working
- Successfully imported 1,219 test provider records from JSON source data

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Viewport-based provider search implemented in Map Service
- Redis caching temporarily disabled due to authentication issues
- Fixed various issues with map-service endpoints:
  - Added proper exception handling for native SQL queries
  - Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in provider search endpoint
  - Improved error response formats with contextual information
  - Modified SQL queries to use proper schema prefixes (`provider.location`)
  - Implemented fallback approach for distance-based sorting
- Comprehensive error response handling added with global exception handler
- Distance-based sorting for providers near user location

### Docker Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS container running and verified
- Redis container configured for future caching needs
- Elasticsearch container added for future text search capabilities
- Docker Compose configuration complete and functional
- Map Service containerized and connected to PostgreSQL successfully

### Flutter-Backend Integration
- Successfully tested connection between Flutter UI and backend map service
- Established proper error handling in Flutter UI for API failures
- Configured CORS to allow Flutter web app to access backend
- Implemented viewport-based provider loading based on map movements
- Set up provider detail display in bottom sheet with location information

## Environment Information
- Development IDE: Cursor
- Java version: 17
- Spring Boot version: 2.7.9
- Docker version: 24.0.6

## Notes for Continuity Between Sessions
- Current focus: Adding more features to the Flutter map interface
- Recent accomplishments: 
  1. Created the initial Flutter UI structure for the user app
  2. Implemented the map component with provider pins
  3. Built the API client to connect to the Map Service
  4. Created provider detail view with comprehensive information display
  5. Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in map-service endpoints
  6. ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Established stable integration between Flutter UI and backend
- Next priorities: 
  1. Create feature branch for further development
  2. Implement marker clustering for better map performance
  3. Add search and filtering capabilities
  4. Configure Redis caching correctly for map service
  5. Begin developing the appointment booking flow
