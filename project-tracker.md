## Technical Decisions & Context
This section captures important technical decisions to maintain continuity between sessions.

### Frontend Framework Migration
- **Decision:** Migrating from Flutter to React Native due to improved community support
- **Impact:** Complete rewrite of frontend applications while backend remains unchanged
- **Advantages:**
  - Larger developer community and ecosystem
  - Strong corporate backing (Facebook/Meta)
  - Mature mapping libraries with OpenStreetMap support
  - TypeScript support for improved type safety
  - Potential for code sharing with web applications
- **Migration Strategy:**
  1. Begin with a proof-of-concept for map features
  2. Phase the transition rather than a complete pause-and-rewrite
  3. Focus on critical path features first (provider search via map)
  4. Reuse backend APIs without modification
- **Key Technical Components:**
  - React Native core
  - React Navigation for routing
  - Redux Toolkit and React Query for state management
  - react-native-maps with OSM configuration
  - Styled components approach for theming

### Database Schema
- Using PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities
- Provider data structured with proper indexing for viewport queries
- Database initialization script created with tables in provider schema
- PostGIS extensions enabled and verified working
- Successfully imported 1,219 test provider records from JSON source data

### API Architecture
- RESTful APIs for standard CRUD operations
- Viewport-based provider search implemented in Map Service
- Redis caching temporarily disabled due to authentication issues
- Fixed various issues with map-service endpoints:
  - Added proper exception handling for native SQL queries
  - Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in provider search endpoint
  - Improved error response formats with contextual information
  - Modified SQL queries to use proper schema prefixes (`provider.location`)
  - Implemented fallback approach for distance-based sorting
- Comprehensive error response handling added with global exception handler
- Distance-based sorting for providers near user location

### OpenStreetMap Implementation
- Decision to use OpenStreetMap with React Native for cost optimization
- Backend map service already provider-agnostic (using PostGIS)
- Implementation planned with the following components:
  1. react-native-maps with OSM tile configuration as primary choice
  2. react-native-mapbox-gl as potential alternative for advanced features
  3. Custom marker components for provider pins
  4. Marker clustering for performance with large datasets
- Potential tile server options:
  - Standard OSM tiles (free, no API key required)
  - MapBox tiles (paid but affordable, better aesthetics)
  - Self-hosted tile server (more control, higher maintenance)
- Geocoding services to consider:
  - Nominatim (free with usage limits)
  - Photon or Pelias (alternatives if needed)
- Estimated cost savings: Potentially $1000s/month for a high-traffic application
- Expected development effort: 3-4 weeks for complete implementation

### Docker Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS container running and verified
- Redis container configured for future caching needs
- Elasticsearch container added for future text search capabilities
- Docker Compose configuration complete and functional
- Map Service containerized and connected to PostgreSQL successfully

## Environment Information

- Java version: 17
- Spring Boot version: 2.7.9

## Notes for Continuity Between Sessions
- Current focus: Migration to React Native with OpenStreetMap integration
- Recent decisions:
  1. Decision to migrate from Flutter to React Native due to community support concerns
  2. Updated architecture documentation to reflect React Native as primary frontend technology
  3. Developed migration strategy focusing on phased transition
  4. Identified react-native-maps as primary mapping library for OpenStreetMap integration
  5. Added new tasks specific to React Native migration in project tracker
- Next priorities: 
  1. Set up initial React Native project structure
  2. Implement OpenStreetMap integration with react-native-maps
  3. Create proof-of-concept for map features
  4. Implement marker clustering for better map performance
  5. Add search and filtering capabilities
  6. Begin developing the appointment booking flow
