4 Great Reasons to Deliver at the Birthplace
===================================
 
1)  No conditions apply on our delivery packages!
 
     The price of your delivery, which is the same for a normal or a C-section delivery, is communicated to you at the time you book your delivery which is the exact same amount that will be billed to you when you check out. In other words, no hidden costs or nasty last-minute surprises!
 
2)  Wait for your baby. Not for your appointment. 
 
      There is no reason why you should be made to wait endlessly to meet your doctor or to get your scan or tests done. We value your time just as you do. Not only will your appointment be on time, but our doctors also spend ample time with you to answer each and every one of your questions - big or small.
 
3)  What about visiting hours? You tell us.
 
      Every hour is a visiting hour at the Birthplace. That said, we''re aware that some moms like to be surrounded by family and friends almost every minute of the day, while others tend to take their privacy a little more seriously. So, it''s entirely up to you. 
You decide when you would like visitors, and we''ll be happy to follow your orders.
       
4)  The best plan ever made. The Birth Plan.

      You love plans. We love plans. And together, we can plan every detail of your baby''s birth which should help you be less Stressed and a lot more in control. The objective of the birth plan, very simply, is to help you feel confident and liberated, Instead of anxious and unsure. It also includes personalized, interactive counselling sessions with the family.

VALUES (817928, 'Mantra Kerali Ayurvedic Hospital', 1, 'The whole world is looking towards Ayurveda & Yoga to restore health globally. Unfortunately the mystic land which gave birth to these fabulous sciences is not utilizing their miraculous healing methods and the invincible principles of life to obtain peace & harmony. We feel this is high time to make the synergised effects of both Ayurveda & Yoga available to one and all.

The Problem:

Human being is the prime victim to the modern life style where improper diet habits, disturbing day to day activities, pollution, ever increasing stress levels and other over whelming occupational hazards produce loads of toxins in the body. These get accumulated and cause a wide range of dreadful diseases, which are impossible to get cured by the present day medical system.

The Solution:

Elimination the toxins both from body & mind is the only way to cure such diseases and rejunevating the body. Mother nature provides us some natural ways to detoxify our body.

Panchakarma:

It is the monumental gift of Ayurveda to detoxify & recharge the body. If comprises a set of bio-purification methods namely.
•	  Vamana - Process of purifying the bodily wastes and eliminating toxins from upper pathways.
•	  Virechana - Process of evacuating harmful toxins through the lower pathways, cleaning the stomach and intestines.
•	  Vasti - The powerful process of cleaning, purifying & strengthening the colon. It nourishes the body, restores & maintains equillibrium to the nervous system.
•	  Nasyam - Insufflation of medicated liquid (or) powder through the nasal passage which directly stimulates the brain.
•	  Raktamokshanam - Letting the impure & stagnated blood out of the body with the help of leeches and other techniques.
At Matra, an experienced team of Ayurvedic Doctors perform these exhilarating procedures in the lap of Mother Nature.

Yoga:

While panchakarma help in cleaning the body, Yoga succors in purifying the mind and turns it cosmically charged.
Our Doctors prescribe medicines along with a set of individualised diet and life style modifications which helps you to tune yourself with your cosmic nature.
We at Mantra are blending the two spectacular sciences to harmonise the human body and to revitalise the soul.', '+914067822336', true, false)

It is a fully air-conditioned hospital with 4 Operation Theatres and a host of specialties and services.

ZOI was started with a singular mission to give world-class and exceptional quality service in the musculoskeletal disorders, disease, and dysfunction, to everyone. In this short span, ZOI has already carved a niche in the area of Orthopedics, Emergency & Trauma, Internal Medicine and Critical care.

ZOI – A way of life The vision behind the beginning of ZOI was to have an institute where extraordinary orthopaedic treatment is pioneered with the intention to make patients get back to active living at the earliest. While their bodies being fit is the focus, we at ZOI believe they should leave the hospital ready and confident to take on life.

At ZOI, all actions are driven by commitment- a place where doctors are proud to belong. The vision is to create institutes for not only innovation in technique and equipment but also pioneering the way orthopaedic care is delivered. In these times of distrust of the medical field, ZOI endeavours to bring transparency and accountability to delivering health care.

Today at ZOI, everyone and everything is driven by passion – passion to excel, passion to provide exceptional care, passion to deliver the good, passion to get trained and developed- all with utmost empathy. You will feel the difference the moment you step in.

The Team ZOI vision has appealed to a lot of eminent doctors, who are extremely successful and pioneers in their own field, to tie up and be a part of the vision. Today the core ortho team is the backbone of the hospital and works together to give each patient the maximum advantage. It is made up of 9 Orthopaedicians with experts in all disciplines of this field (we think it is the most cohesive orthopaedic team in the twin states), ably supported by Internal medicine specialists (Internists), Intensivist, Anaesthetist and Pain Management specialists, Plastic Surgeons, Vascular Surgeons, Neurosurgeons, Wound care specialists.

There is a very committed and skilled physiotherapy team and Dietician too. Together, ZOI brings to you a team of meticulous experts who will ensure that your health is in the safest of hands.

Considering the time constraint for working professionals, ZOI caters to the needs of patients across the city in the late evenings every day & even on Sunday. We have doctors available till 8pm at somajiguda and 9 pm at attapur, where we encourage our patients to come in leisurely post their work hours. ZOI acknowledges the needs of the patients & provides necessary care.Our singular mission to give world-class and exceptional quality service at worthwhile cost, stays true to this day with the most cohesive team of doctors taking forth care to new heights. With Zoi, care is key and so are the possibilities you can garner from an active lifestyle after your meet us. The main philosophy of Zoi is to understand and empathize with your pain and provide therapy which is suitable to what you need.

Zoi is one of the top 10 critical care services at Hyderabad as per TOI survey in 2016. We strive to extend our reach to as many patients as possible with multiple locations and 24/7 emergency trauma services. In this era, we dedicatedly provide holistic care with empathy to break the stigma of hospitals being commercialized.
