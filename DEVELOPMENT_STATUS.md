- ✅ Configured `babel.config.js` for Reanimated.
- ✅ Attempted to create Android development build.

### 2. Search Service Integration
- ✅ Leveraged existing search-service for provider discovery

- ✅ Ensured proper service structure and endpoints

### 3. Map Service
- ✅ Maintained existing map service functionality for geospatial queries
- ✅ Ensured compatibility with both chat and search services

## Current Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** React Native with TypeScript (migrated from Flutter)
- **Backend Services:**
  - Java 17 + Spring Boot microservices
  - Simplified AI implementation for chat
  - PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data
- **Containerization:** Docker with docker-compose for local development

## Current Challenges & Roadblocks

1. **Android Native Build Failure (`Unresolved reference: serviceOf`)**
   - Running `npx expo run:android` fails during the Gradle build process.
   - Error originates from `@react-native/gradle-plugin/build.gradle.kts`.
   - Likely caused by incompatibility between Gradle version, Expo SDK, and/or React Native version.
   - Cleaning the Gradle build (`.\gradlew clean`) did not resolve the issue.
   - **This is the primary blocker preventing frontend testing.**

2. **Requirement for Development Build**
   - Due to added native dependencies (Reanimated, Keyboard Controller), Expo Go can no longer be used.
   - A successful development build (`npx expo run:android`) is required for testing.

3. **DJL Library Integration Issues**
   - The original Deep Java Library (DJL) implementation caused dependency conflicts
   - Resolution: Created simplified implementation without DJL for initial deployment
   - Future work: Properly integrate DJL with correct dependencies and repository configuration

4. **Service Discovery Implementation Required**
   - The `discovery-server` (Eureka) is defined as a dependency in `docker-compose.yml` but is not yet implemented.
   - This is blocking the build process for dependent services like `chat-service`.
   - Resolution: Implement the `discovery-server` with necessary configuration and dependencies.
   - Next Step: Configure all other microservices as Eureka clients.

5. **Multiple Application Classes**
   - Multiple main application classes caused build confusion
   - Resolution: Specified main class in pom.xml
   - Future work: Clean up duplicate application classes

6. **Package Structure Inconsistency**
   - Code is split between `com.healthcare` and `com.provider` packages
   - Future work: Standardize on single package structure

## Next Development Steps

1.  **Resolve Android Gradle Build Failure**
    - Investigate Gradle version compatibility.
    - Check Expo SDK / React Native / Gradle plugin versions for conflicts.
    - Potentially update Gradle wrapper properties or plugin versions.
    - Consult Expo and React Native documentation for troubleshooting native build errors.

2.  **Successfully Create Development Build**
    - Run `npx expo run:android` after fixing the Gradle issue.
    - Install the development build on the emulator/device.

3.  **Test Frontend Functionality**
    - Verify Home, Search, and Chat screens render correctly in the development build.
    - Test API connections from the frontend to the running backend services (Map, Chat, Search).

4. **Implement Discovery Service**
   - Create `pom.xml` and source code for Eureka server.
   - Configure and build the Docker image.
   - Integrate with `docker-compose`.

5. **Resolve Chat Service Build Issues**
   - Once Discovery Service is available, rebuild `chat-service`.
   - Fix any remaining dependency issues (including DJL).

6. **Docker Deployment Refinement**
   - Complete docker-compose setup for all required services
   - Resolve remaining dependency issues
   - Ensure proper networking between containers

7. **Enhanced AI Integration**
   - Properly integrate DJL or alternative AI libraries
   - Implement more sophisticated symptom-to-specialist mapping
   - Add real-time learning capabilities

8. **Frontend Integration**
   - Complete React Native integration with all backend services
   - Implement real-time chat UI with WebSocket support
   - Enhance map view with provider data

9. **Multi-language Support**
   - Extend symptom mapping to support multiple languages
   - Implement localization across the platform

10. **Security Enhancements**
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization
    - Secure all API endpoints
    - Ensure CORS is properly configured for production

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Resolve DJL dependency issues with proper Maven repository configuration
   - Standardize dependency versions across services
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies

2. **Service Architecture**
   - Implement Eureka server for service discovery.
   - Configure all microservices as Eureka clients.
   - Ensure consistent registration and discovery across the platform.

3. **Code Structure**
   - Standardize package naming (com.healthcare vs. com.provider)
   - Remove duplicate application classes
   - Ensure consistent coding style across all services

4. **Gradle Configuration and Dependencies**
    - Ensure Gradle version, Android Gradle Plugin version, and React Native Gradle Plugin versions are compatible.
    - Audit and potentially update React Native and Expo SDK versions for stability.

## Development Environment

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 2.7.9
- Maven 3.8.4
- Docker/Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS

## Notes for Next Development Session

- **Primary Focus:** Resolve the Android Gradle build error (`Unresolved reference: serviceOf`). This is critical to proceed with any frontend testing or development.
- Investigate potential version mismatches between Expo SDK (49), React Native (0.72.x), and the Gradle setup.
- Once the build succeeds, run the development build on the emulator and test the basic screen navigation and service connections.

This document captures the current state of development as of May, 2025 and will be updated as the project progresses.
