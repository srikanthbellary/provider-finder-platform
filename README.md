# Provider Finder Platform 
A healthcare provider discovery and appointment management system. This platform helps users find healthcare providers based on symptoms, specialties, or direct provider search, with an intuitive map-based interface.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
1. Navigate to Expo app directory:
   ```bash
   cd apps/user-app-expo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
Note: Use Expo Go app to run on a physical device or emulator.

## Backend Services

### Running with Docker
You can run the backend services using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start the main services
docker-compose up -d postgres map-service chat-service

# Check running services
docker-compose ps

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```
